A web-based UI to manage multiple [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) instances using a modern stack, including:

- **Backend**: Go (Golang) with Gin, and BadgerDB as the NoSQL key-value store.
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui.
- **Database**: Embedded BadgerDB for lightweight NoSQL storage.
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Package Registry.

## Features

- Manage multiple Caddy instances via the Caddy Admin API.
- Add, list, and delete Caddy instances.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (for local development)

For development on your MacBook Pro (M3 Pro), ensure you have:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (for frontend) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for package management.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/caddy-web-ui.git
cd caddy-web-ui
```

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Go Modules**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. **Run the Backend** (for local development):

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:

   Via npm (you should already have Node.js installed):

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Frontend** (for local development):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Docker Setup

1. **Build Docker Images**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will start both the backend and frontend, accessible at:

   - **Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Backend**: `http://localhost:8080`

---

## Running the Project

### Running with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- The frontend runs by default on `http://localhost:3000`.
- The backend API is available at `http://localhost:8080`.

You can modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to suit your needs (e.g., change ports or add services).
